    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Skoleboller, sometimes called "Skolebrod" is another traditoinal Norwegian baking recipe. Any cafe in Norway will sell
        Skoleboller - even most grocery stores will have them. The base recipe is the same as for 'boller' and then you create
        a delicious custard to go in the middle. Finish it by adding a powdered sugar glaze sprinkled with coconut on top. Kind of
        interesting how this is such a traditional Norwegian food when coconut is not at all native to Norway...</p>
