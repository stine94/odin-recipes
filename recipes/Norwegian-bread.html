    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Ever since moving to the US, I have been struggeling to find good bread in the grocery stores! It always tastes too sweet to me.
            That is why I have decided to bake my own. This is a healthy whole wheat brad with lots of fiber. Freeze and pop in the microwave
            when you want some delicious healthy Norwegian bread.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>10 tablespoons of oatmeal</li>
            <li>10 tablespoons sunflower seeds</li>
            <li>5 tablespoons of pumpkin seeds</li>
            <li>5 tablespoons of flaxseed</li>
            <li>5 tablespoons of sesame seeds</li>
            <li>Sesame Seeds</li>
            <li>7 dl water</li>
            <li>500 grams of whole wheat flour</li>
            <li>200 grams of rye flour</li>
            <li>700 grams of flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of honey</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of oil</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Phase 1: Place oatmeal, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, linseed and sesame seeds in a bowl. Add cold water and let the seeds and kernels swell for at least 1.5 times. I usually soak them overnight.</li>
            <li>Phase 2: Put all the dry ingredients in a baking dish. Add cold or medium cold water (max 15 degrees), honey, oil and the soaked seeds, and knead the dough well. I recommend using a food processor for the best possible result. The dough is kneaded for approximately 20 minutes, until it is supple and elastic. If it seems a little dry and hard towards the end of the kneading time, you can add a little more water, if it is just porridge, add more flour. The dough should feel a little sticky.</li>
            <li>Proofing: Cover the baking bowl with plastic or a lid. Let the dough rise for approximately 1.5 hours, until it has risen to double its size. The rising time will vary based on the temperature in the room and how cold water is used.</li>
            <li>Baking: Transfer the finished dough onto a well-floured surface. Knead it together lightly. Sprinkle on a little flour if the dough feels very sticky.</li>
            <li>Divide the dough into three equal parts. Shape each item into oblong sausages that are placed in greased or baking paper-lined loaf tins. My bread tins hold 1.5 litres.</li>
            <li>Proof the loaves for approximately 30-45 minutes under a cloth. Check during the process that they do not grow out of the bread forms. Preheat the oven to 240 degrees, conventional top and bottom heat.</li>
            <li>Baking: Insert the bread forms at the bottom of the oven. Turn down the temperature to 220 degrees and let the loaves bake for approximately 37 minutes. To check whether the bread is ready, you can take one of the loaves out of the mold and pinch it on the underside. If it sounds hollow, the loaves are ready.</li>
        </ul>
